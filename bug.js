This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `getInitialURL` method returns `null` even when a deep link is opened, particularly on iOS. This can be due to several factors, including incorrect URL schemes, incorrect AppDelegate configuration (for iOS), or timing issues where `getInitialURL` is called before the app has fully processed the deep link.
